# Getting started

To help you set up and begin using MKE 4k quickly and effectively, Mirantis
offers a selection of lightweight instructions, organized into high-level
steps.

{{% steps %}}

### Meet the system requirements

Ensure that your system meets the necessary hardware and software
requirements for installing and running an MKE 4k cluster. For full
details, refer to the  [System requirements](system-requirements).

### Install the MKE 4k CLI and other dependencies

[Install the MKE 4k Command Line Interface (CLI)](install-mke-4k-cli), which is
essential for managing your MKE 4k installation. The CLI provides a convenient
and powerful way to interact with your cluster, perform administrative tasks,
and automate workflows.

### Obtain and apply an MKE 4k License

You must [have a valid license to lawfully run MKE 4k](licensing-mke4).

{{< callout type="info" >}} Mirantis recommends that you set the license in the
MKE 4k configuration file prior to the creation of your MKE 4k cluster. You can, however, [apply the
license following cluster creation using the MKE 4k web
UI](licensing-mke4/apply-mke4k-license-post-installation).

### Create a cluster

The [creation of an MKE 4k cluster](create-cluster) involves configuring the
cluster settings, specifying the number of nodes, and setting up networking and
storage options. Use the MKE 4k CLI to initialize and configure the cluster
according to your requirements.

### Interact with the cluster

Once created, you can interact with your MKE 4k cluster, using it to deploy
applications and services, and thus leverage its full capabilities for
container orchestration and management.

In addition, this **Getting started** section offers such other key MKE 4k
information as [how to perform an offline installation](offline-installation), [how to use kubectl to access and manage
your cluster](access-manage-cluster-kubectl), [how to add and remove cluster
nodes](add-and-remove-cluster-nodes), [how to obtain the current MKE 4k
configuration file](get-current-mke-config), and [how to uninstall a
cluster](uninstall-cluster).
