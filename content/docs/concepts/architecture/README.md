# MKE Architecture

## Overview

MKE4 is an enterprise-grade, production-ready Kubernetes platform that is designed to be secure, scalable, and reliable. MKE4 is deployed using a MKE [configuration file](./configuration.md)

## Components

MKE 4 is built on top of k0s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution. See the [k0s documentation](https://k0sproject.io/docs/) for more information.

MKE 4 Alpha.1 is run on top of k0s v1.29.3. 

### Control Plane

<[Explain the control plane components and their roles]>

#### CNI

By default, MKE 4 installs Calico as the CNI plugin. This is done by specifying `calico` in the network provider field of the k0s config.
Calico is installed with the following configuration:
- IPv4 only with a fixed pod CIDR of `10.244.0.0/16`.
- The datastore mode is set to `kdd`.
- `kube-proxy` set to `iptables` mode. 
- `vxlan` backend, which uses the default port of `4789` for traffic and default virtual network ID of `4096`.
  
With the Alpha.1 release, MKE 4 has the following limitations:
- There is no option to use a different CNI plugin.
- There is no option to configure Calico from the above defaults.
- When a cluster is upgraded from MKE 3, the Calico configuration is not migrated.
