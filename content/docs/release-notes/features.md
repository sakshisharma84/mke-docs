## 4.0.0-alpha.2.0

### MKE Dashboard

- Metrics including node performance with usage statistics
- Basic Kubernetes management (View, Create, Update, and Delete):
  - Configurations: ConfigMaps
  - Controllers: ReplicaSets, ReplicationControllers, StatefulSets, Jobs, CronJobs, Daemonsets, and Deployments
  - Namespaces
  - Nodes
  - Pods
  - Services
  - ServiceAccounts
  - Storage: StorageClasses, PersistantVolumes + PersistantVolumeClaims
- View with Kubernetes resources by namespace or all namespaces at once

#### Namespace management

Namespaces can now be managed by clicking on the active namespace in the side menu.
This opens the namespace selector.

From there, if you want to manage your namespaces further (add, remove, etc), you
can click the Manage namespaces button at the bottom left to view the list of namespaces.

To return to the main menu, click the "Dashboard" icon in the breadcrumbs or
the back arrow next to the "active namespace" in the side navigation.

Here you will also find links to documentation and the "Sign out" option.
